## Minimum requirements for works

To expect your work to be accepted into the project, a few minimum requirements must be met.

### In a suitable format

Screenshots should be initially captured and drawings saved in `PNG` graphic format (uncompressed). For videos, `MP4` or
`AVI` format with a high bitrate is suitable. Files can be folded into a `ZIP` archive for easy transfer. File
requirements for automatic verification:

| Resource type | Format       |  Height | Width   |  Duration | Framerate |     Size |
| ------------- | :----------- | ------: | ------: | --------: | --------: | -------: |
| Image         | `PNG`        |   ≥ 800 |   ≥ 800 |           |           |   ≤ 5 MB |
| Video         | `MP4` `AVI`  |  ≥ 1080 |  ≥ 1080 |  ≥ 10 sec |  ≥ 30 fps | ≤ 200 MB |
| Archive       | `ZIP`        |         |         |           |           | ≤ 100 MB |

### No interface elements

All interface elements (crosshair, map, health bars, menu, console, etc.) should be hidden from the screen. You can
disable the interface with the console command `tm` or `ToggleMenus`. In the OpenMW engine, you can use the `F11` key
for the same purpose.

### No modifications

There should be no content or graphical modifications to the game, except for official modifications from Bethesda
Softworks. Work will be rejected if there are textures, models, objects, or situations that could not have been in the
original game. Currently, the use of official addons Tribunal and Bloodmoon and [auxiliary plugins](#auxiliary-plugins)
is allowed.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Remember that mysterious fog, an understated color scheme, and strange angular shapes are important parts of the
> atmosphere of our favorite game. Your goal is not to demonstrate the possibilities of mods but to show how beautiful
> the game can be without them.

### Unprocessed

Screenshots and videos that have been processed in a graphic editor beforehand will not be accepted. Minor processing is
allowed only during the editing process. If you still want to offer your own variant of processing, be sure to send the
original image as well.

## Shooting tips

To make it easier to take high-quality pictures, follow these tips.

### Game engine and utilities

Preferably use the latest version of the [OpenMW](https://openmw.org/) engine or the vanilla Morrowind engine with
[MGE](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102). You need to set high resolution and enable anti-aliasing. You can
enable slight graphical enhancements, such as water shaders. You can increase the number of loadable cells in exteriors,
but using distant land is not recommended.

To take screenshots in the vanilla engine, use the `PrtScn` key, and in the OpenMW engine, use the `F12` key. To capture
video, you can use screen capture programs such as [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/).

### Aspect ratio

Keep in mind that your screenshot may be cropped before publishing, so all the important objects should stay in the
final format and the composition should remain balanced. To simplify things, you can purposely launch the game in a
window with the desired aspect ratio. A common scenario is to run the game in a window with resolution 1080x1080.

### Field of view

You can change the field of view in the game settings on the fly, increasing it to get more objects in the frame or,
vice versa, decreasing it to get a close-up. Be sure to do so within reasonable limits and avoid distorting the
perspective too much.

### Drawing distance and fog

Control the viewing distance in the game settings, depending on your artistic intent. Sometimes it's better to cover the
distant background with haze to keep the viewer's attention on the main foreground objects. For shooting distant
backgrounds, you can slightly increase the drawing distance. Make sure that the look of the game remains close to
vanilla.

### Free camera

The console command `tcl` or `ToggleCollision` enables the free camera mode, in which you can levitate freely and walk
through walls. This helps you get interesting shots from hard-to-reach angles.

### God mode

The `tgm` or `ToggleGodMode` console command protects you from falling damage and character attacks, allowing you to
concentrate on shooting without worrying about the protagonist's health. The [NoFightNoHello](#nofightnohello) plugin
can also protect you from character attacks, but it will be harder to shoot battle scenes with it.

### Quick travel

To travel to an exterior without a name, type its coordinates in the console:

```txt
coe 10 -5
```

To travel to an exterior with a name or to an interior, type its name:

```txt
coc "Ald-ruhn, Manor District"
```

### Movement speed

To speed up your character a lot, type in the console:

```txt
player->setspeed 500
```

You can set higher values. This helps you move around the world faster while looking for shooting locations. Once you
find a shooting location, you'll want to get a more accurate angle by slowing down your movement. To make your character
as slow as possible, type:

```txt
player->setspeed 0
```

### Time of day

When shooting exteriors, it can be useful to adjust the lighting or moon position by changing the time of day. For
example, if you want to shoot during sunset at 7:00 PM, you need to type in the console:

```txt
set gamehour to 19
```

## Auxiliary plugins

The listed plugins give you additional options when shooting.

### NoFightNoHello

Turns off greeting phrases and removes aggression from all NPCs and creatures. Allows you to take screenshots without
distracting from gameplay.

[Download](assets/plugins/NoFightNoHello.esp)

### MannequinChallenge

Applies a permanent paralysis effect to an NPC or creature. Allows you to lock a character in one place to make shooting
easier.

[Download](assets/plugins/MannequinChallenge.esp)

To apply the effect, you need to open the console, select the character, and type:

```txt
addspell mannequinchallenge
```

To remove the effect:

```txt
removespell mannequinchallenge
```

### TrackPath

Allows you to record the player's movement along three coordinates and play it back smoothly later. Suitable for
preparing smooth movement through the game world when shooting video. Works well only on the OpenMW engine.

[Download](assets/plugins/TrackPath.esp)

To start recording the player's movement, open the console and type:

```txt
set trackPath to 1
```

A message will appear that the recording of path `PATH_NUMBER` has started. You need to memorize this number to be able
to play the recorded path later. Move your character around the game world. You can move between locations by activating
doors; the recording of movement will continue.

To stop the recording of the player's movement, you need to type in the console:

```txt
set trackPath to 0
```

Before playing the recorded path, you need to move the character to the original location, where the beginning of the
path is located. To play the recorded path `PATH_NUMBER`, type in the console:

```txt
set playPath to PATH_NUMBER
```

The path will start playing, smoothly moving your character through the world. The transition between locations is not
automatic. You need to manually activate the doors when you are close to them to continue playing the path. You can
interrupt playing the path with the command:

```txt
set playPath to 0
```

## Editing

Editing is performed by the project administrator. You can follow the process on the pages of the
[proposed posts](docs/inbox/index.md) section. If you have any questions, write to
[administrator](docs/contributors.md#dehero) in any convenient way.

### Search for violations

The content of the post is manually checked, and if any violations are found, the post is moved to
[trash](docs/inbox/index.md). Possible violations:

- Inappropriate content
- Graphic issues
- Non-vanilla look
- Uses or requires mods
- UI is visible

### Merging posts

Multiple variants of the same work are merged into a single post to make it easier to choose which variant to publish.
This is done using
[merging issue](https://github.com/dehero/mwscr/issues/new?labels=merging&template=merging.yml&title=POST_ID).

If the work is a response to one of the pending requests, it is merged with the original request into a single post.

### File processing

Files added to `store:/inbox` are processed with the graphics editor, which may include:

- cropping;
- brightness adjustment;
- correction of technical errors in shooting (in rare cases);
- duration trimming (for video).

Processing is intended to improve the perception of the original work while preserving the original content as much as
possible.

> [!CAUTION]  
> It is forbidden to change the color scheme, apply filters, add, change, or distort objects.

During processing, the original files remain intact, and each new variant is saved to a separate file with the variant
number appended to the file name. For example:

```txt
dehero.2024-02-17-10-53-36.png
dehero.2024-02-17-10-53-36.1.png
dehero.2024-02-17-10-53-36.2.png
```

Processed versions will be added to [proposed posts](docs/inbox/index.md) the next time files are imported from the
repository.

### Preparing a post

Use [editing issue](https://github.com/dehero/mwscr/issues/new?labels=editing&template=editing.yml&title=POST_ID) to
fill in the post fields.

determined, the region of shooting is specified (for exterior shots).

### Selecting an editor's mark

The editor's mark helps to filter proposed works and monitor the overall quality of the project's post feed. To set a
mark [review issue](https://github.com/dehero/mwscr/issues/new?labels=review&template=review.yml&title=POST_ID) is used.

The mark is subjective, but the general guidelines for selecting it are described here:

| Indicator         | `A1`  | `A2`  | `B1`  | `B2`  | `C` | `D` | `E` | `F` | Evaluated                                             |
| ----------------- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Artistry          | +     | +     | ±     |       |     |     | ±   |     | Beauty, intent.                                       |
| Neatness          | +     | +     | ±     | +     |     |     |     |     | Graphics, framing.                                    |
| Composition       | +     | ±     | +     | ±     | ±   |     | ±   |     | Foreshortening, placement of objects.                 |
| Lighting          | +     | ±     | +     | ±     | ±   |     | ±   |     | Light and colors.                                     |
| Experiment        |       |       |       |       |     |     | +   |     | Unconventional view.                                  |
| Fail              |       |       |       |       |     |     |     | +   | Potential for reshooting or revisiting.               |
| **Publishable**   |  ✓    |  ✓    | ✓     | ✓     | ✓   |     | ✓   |     |                                                       |

A work will receive the mark given in the title of the column if:

1. All indicators marked `+` are completed;
2. At least one of the indicators marked `±` is filled in.

If the selected mark is not publishable, such work is moved to [trash](docs/trash/index.md).
