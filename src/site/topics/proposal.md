# propose work

Before you can propose your screenshots, videos or drawings, read the [core principles](./core-principles.md) and
[shooting tips](./shooting-tips.md). Then send your work in any convenient way. Provide your profile addresses if you
want a link to you in the post when the work is published. Proposed works will be automatically checked and will go to
[Inbox](./inbox.md). After [editing](./editing.md), your works will be [published](./publication.md) or
[rejected](./trash.md). By submitting your work, you agree that it will be stored in the project archive and may be used
in any sources related to the project, with attribution to you.
