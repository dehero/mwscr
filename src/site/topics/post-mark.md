# editor's mark

The editor's mark helps to filter [proposed works](./inbox.md) and monitor the overall quality of the project's post
feed [during editing](./editing.md). "A1" and "A2" are the first-class posts, most beautiful and artistic. "B1" and "B2"
are more ordinary posts, but still good enough. "C" is used in rare cased for not very good but publishable posts. "E"
marks experimental posts, which seem interesting but without certainty. "D" means that the post is too ordinary or
doubling and should be deleted to [Trash](./trash.md). "F" marks failed post attempts, that become candidates for
reshooting or revisiting. They are stored in Trash too. Keep in mind that the mark is subjective and there is a more
objective [post rating](./post-rating.md) score that evaluates published posts by subscribers reactions.
