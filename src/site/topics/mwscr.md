# Morrowind Screenshots

The goal of the project is to seek out the hidden beauty and celebrate the visual aesthetics of
[Morrowind](./morrowind.md). Project authors capture them by making ingame
[screenshots and videos or drawings](./post-types.md), which are then [reviewed by the editor](./editing.md) and pearled
off for [publication](./publication.md) in all project's accounts. There are some
[core principles](./core-principles.md) that the project follows. Anyone is welcome to
[contribute to the project](./contributing.md).
