# no modifications

There should be no content or graphical modifications to the game, except for
[allowed modifications](./allowed-mods.md). Work will be [rejected](./violations.md) if there are textures, models,
objects, or situations that could not have been in the original game with addons. Remember that mysterious fog, an
understated color scheme, and strange angular shapes are important parts of the atmosphere of our favorite game. Your
goal is not to demonstrate the possibilities of mods but to show how beautiful the game can be without them.
