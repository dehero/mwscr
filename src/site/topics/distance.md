# viewing distance and fog

Control the viewing distance in the game settings, depending on your artistic intent. Sometimes it's better to cover the
distant background with haze to keep the viewer's attention on the main foreground objects. For shooting distant
backgrounds, you can slightly increase the drawing distance. Make sure that the look of the game remains close to
vanilla.
