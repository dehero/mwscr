# god mode

The "tgm" or "ToggleGodMode" console command protects you from falling damage and character attacks, allowing you to
concentrate on shooting without worrying about the protagonist's health. The [NoFightNoHello](./nofightnohello.md)
plugin can also protect you from character attacks, but it will be harder to shoot battle scenes with it.
