# no interface elements

For [Posts](./posts.md) section all interface elements (crosshair, map, health bars, menu, console, etc.) should be
hidden from the screen. You can disable the interface with the console command "tm" or "ToggleMenus". In the
[OpenMW](./openmw.md) engine, you can use the "F11" key for the same purpose.
