# movement speed

To speed up your character a lot, type in the console "player->setspeed 500". You can set higher values. This helps you
move around the world faster while looking for shooting locations. Once you find a shooting location, you'll want to get
a more accurate angle by slowing down your movement. To make your character as slow as possible, type "player->setspeed
0".
