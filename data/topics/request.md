# request a screenshot or video

To ask the authors of the project to make a certain screenshot or video, leave a free-form message in any convenient
way. The easiest way is to write a comment or private message to the administrator in any of the project accounts. Your
request will be added to [Drafts](./drafts.md) and will remain there, waiting for the appropriate material. The request
may be rejected if it does not meet the [core principles](./core-principles.md).

[Send request via GitHub Issues](https://github.com/dehero/mwscr/issues/new?labels=post-request&template=post-request.yml&title=Cool+to+see%2C+how+cliffracer+dies%21)  
[Send to administrator via email](mailto:dehero@outlook.com?subject=mwscr)
