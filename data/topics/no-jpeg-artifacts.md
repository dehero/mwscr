# no JPEG artifacts

Screenshots for [Posts](./posts.md) section should be initially captured in "PNG" or "BMP" graphic format
(uncompressed). It is not allowed to convert images originally saved as "JPEG" to "PNG" to circumvent this restriction.
Compression artifacts remain visible in the image and spoil the purity of the original screenshot.
