# no JPEG artifacts

All screenshots must be originally shot in "PNG" or other uncompressed format. It is not allowed to convert images
originally saved as "JPEG" to "PNG" to circumvent [file format restrictions](./file-format.md). Compression artifacts
remain visible in the image and spoil the purity of the original screenshot.
