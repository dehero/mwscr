Too far [viewing distance](./distance.md), Distant Land, eye-catching shadows, color shaders, and other visual effects
that are at odds with [Morrowind](./morrowind.md)'s original aesthetic should be avoided when shooting footage for a
project.

Remember that mysterious fog, an understated color scheme, and strange angular shapes are important parts of the
atmosphere of our favorite game. Your goal is not to demonstrate the possibilities of mods but to show how beautiful the
game can be without them.
