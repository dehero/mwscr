# editor's mark

The editor's mark helps to filter [Inbox](./inbox.md) and monitor the overall quality of the project's post feed
[during editing](./editing.md). "A1" and "A2" are the first-class posts, most beautiful and artistic. "B1" and "B2" are
more ordinary posts, but still good enough. "C" is used in rare cased for not very good but publishable posts. "E" marks
experimental posts, which seem interesting but without certainty. "D" means that the post is too ordinary or doubling
and should be deleted to [Trash](./trash.md). "F" marks failed post attempts, that become candidates for reshooting or
revisiting. They are stored in Trash too. Keep in mind that the mark is subjective and there is a more objective
[post rating](./post-rating.md) score that evaluates published posts by subscribers reactions.
