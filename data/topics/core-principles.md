# core principles

The [Morrowind Screenshots](./mwscr.md) project follows the core principles, which are not going to be changed ever. No
[third-party mods](./no-mods.md) are welcome. No [processing](./no-processing.md) should be used. No
[user interface](./no-ui.md) should be visible. Incoming [file format](./file-format.md) should be appropriate. To
expect your work [to be accepted](./proposal.md) into the project, described minimum requirements must be met.
