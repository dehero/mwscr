# core principles

The [Morrowind Screenshots](./mwscr.md) project follows the core principles, which are not going to be changed ever. No
[graphic and unlore mods](./no-mods.md) are welcome. No [processing](./no-processing.md) should be used. No
[user interface](./no-ui.md) should be visible.

To expect your work [to be accepted](./proposal.md) into the [Posts](./posts.md) section, described minimum requirements
must be met and all possible [violations](./violations.md) should be avoided. Otherwise, you can consider getting into
[Extras](./extras.md) section which is more democratic.
