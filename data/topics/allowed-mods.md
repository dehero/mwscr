# allowed modifications

Official expansions Tribunal and Bloodmoon from Bethesda Softworks and the white list of unofficial expansions, which
currently includes only [Tamriel Rebuilt](./tamriel-rebuilt.md), are allowed. Plugins that give you additional options
when shooting but don't change the game visually such as [NoFightNoHello](./nofightnohello.md),
[MannequinChallenge](./mannequinchallenge.md) and [TrackPath](./trackpath.md) are allowed also.
