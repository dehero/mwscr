# shooting tips

To make it easier to take high-quality pictures, use appropriate
[game engine and utilities](./game-engine-and-utilities.md), select lossless [file format](./file-format.md), keep in
mind [aspect ratio](./aspect-ratio.md), adjust [field of view](./fov.md) and [time of day](./gamehour.md) on the fly,
control the [drawing distance and fog](./distance.md), always use [free camera](./free-camera.md) and
[god mode](./god-mode.md), try to [move quickly](./player-speed.md) and feel free to [quick travel](./quick-travel.md).

Also, remember about [auxilary plugins](./allowed-mods.md) that make the shooting process easier.
