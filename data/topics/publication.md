# publication

[Inbox](./inbox.md) posts that have successfully passed [editing](./editing.md) are placed to the shortlist, from where
they are gradually taken to create new posts. A new post is selected every day. The post is published simultaneously on
all project accounts that support this type of post. Previously published posts may be published again, without changes,
or as part of a different [post type](./post-types.md). The text of the post includes: [title](./post-title.md),
description (if any), [author](./post-author.md) (if the author is not the project administrator), requester (if the
post was made by request), [tags](./post-tags.md), [location](./post-location.md) (if available).
