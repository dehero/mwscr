# aspect ratio

Keep in mind that your screenshot or video [may be cropped](./allowed-processing.md) before the publication, so all the
important objects should stay in the final format and the composition should remain balanced. To simplify things, you
can purposely launch the game in a window with the desired aspect ratio. A common scenario is to run the game in a
window with resolution 1080x1080, which is the most common image size for [Shots](./shot.md).
