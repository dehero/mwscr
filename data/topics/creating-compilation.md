# create compilation

Right click (long tap) on published post to show the context menu. Click "Select" button to start selecting posts, then
select posts you want to compile together. Use filters and sorting to find posts in the list.

After selecting all needed posts click "Compile Selected" on the toolbar to create compilation draft. You need 4 shots
to create [Shot Compilation](./shot-set.md) that can be published.
