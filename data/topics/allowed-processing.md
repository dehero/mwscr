# allowed processing

Content added to [Drafts](./drafts.md) can be processed with the graphics editor during
[the editing process](./editing.md). Processing is intended to improve the perception of the original work while
preserving the original content as much as possible. It may include cropping, brightness adjustment, correction of
technical errors in shooting (in rare cases), duration trimming (for video). It is forbidden to change the color scheme,
apply filters, add, change, or distort objects. During processing, the original files remain intact, and each new
variant is saved to a separate file with the variant number appended to the file name.
