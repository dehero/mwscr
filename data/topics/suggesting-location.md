# find missing location

If the location of shooting the screenshot or video is not specified in the post, you can suggest one. Navigate to post
page or right click (long tap) on post to show the context menu. Click "Locate" button and choose location from the list
in the dialog. You can select multiple locations if needed.

Submit your suggestion using any of available submitting options in the dialog. Another option is to write a comment
with the suggested location under post in any of project's channels. The project administrator will check your
suggestion and accept it if it was confirmed.
