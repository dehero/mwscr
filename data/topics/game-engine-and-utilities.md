# game engine and utilities

Preferably use the latest version of the [OpenMW](./openmw.md) engine or the vanilla engine with [MGE](./mge.md). You
need to set high resolution and enable anti-aliasing. You can enable slight graphical enhancements, such as water
shaders. You can increase the number of loadable cells in exteriors, but using distant land is not recommended. To take
screenshots in the vanilla engine, use the "PrtScn" key, and in the OpenMW engine, use the "F12" key. To capture video,
you can use screen capture programs such as OBS Studio.
